This code is an example of how to use various array functions with real-world dataset.

The dataset in this example is a list of all Pokemon types with their resistances and weaknesses.

Using this code:
  Run filter.js with node, enter a JavaScript statement to return a value.
  
  Example:  Want to know what types are weak to ground and what types are immune to ghost, type:
              \n pokemon.weakness == "Ground" || pokemon.immune == "Ghost"
